Grateful Dead 

Casey Jones 

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

This old engine makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
'Bout a quarter to nine
Hits River Junction at seventeen: two
At a quarter to ten
You know it's travelin' again

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead!
Switchman's sleeping
Train hundred and two is
On the wrong track
And headed for you!

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

Drive your train
Whoo!

Trouble with you
Is the trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But you still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?

And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind?
